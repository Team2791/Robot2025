# Constants

All non-unitless measurements are in metric units: radians, kilograms, meters, seconds, and combinations thereof.

We're not using WPI's UoM types here because it's not completely intuitive and
completely limited by Java not having useful features to make it good.

Someday I'll try to make my own uom lib comparable to rust's, but with the limitations of
Java's underpowered type system, I don't think it's going to be possible.
